# Northwind

UNSTABLE: Very early development and untested.

Northwind is a small Java-based engine for text-based adventure/RPG games.
It is also a small game that was made with the engine.

## Engine

The engine uses Java 11 syntax and features heavy use of annotations
and interfaces with default implementations.
Moreover, there is a heavy use of reflection.

Annotations are used to provide static templates that are loaded by empty class constructors.

Interfaces are used to denote what capabilities are available. 

## Game

The game part has not yet been started.
